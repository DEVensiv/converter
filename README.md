# converter
Wrap lines of a file into quotation marks and adds ',' at the end of each line except the last one.

This also escapes quotation marks using '\' ('"' -> '\"') which may occur in some lines

# why
Makes it easy to include larger files of text directly in code as a string array. (e.g. C in case of microcontroller code where you cant have files)
